## Data Analytics

1. Title 1 Texas school district report
    - Utilized sklearn, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries within python
      notebooks. Performed cleaning, exploration, normalization and
      visualization of Texas school districts data. Utilized linear regression
       and decision tree models to analyze the effects of poverty levels.
    - Data pulled from Common Core Data (CCD)
    - Relevent Files: CCD_Final.ipynb
    
## Other Resume Projects (Available by request)
#### *Not public by professor request*

1. Discrete Time Event Simulation
    - Programming Language: Python
    - CPU simulation from a list of 10,000 generated "processes". 
      Uses four different queues to simulate the processes requesting CPU time.
      After the process list has been simulated, the performance metrics are calculated.
      
2. Parallel K-means Clustering
    - Programming Language: C with CUDA
    - Dividing n observations into x clusters using k-means. Uses atomic operations to update array data in parallel. 
      Utilizing CUDA multiple GPUs where used in the UT supercomputer cluster to time and run the program.

## Other School Projects

1. Certificate Authority Builder
    - Programming Language: Python
    - Using VirtualBox environment to build directories and package certificate authority bundle.
    - Relevent Files: CABuilder.py

2. ChatBox GUI
    - Programming Language: Java
    - All files for the project are not posted by proffessor request, this is just the graphical user interface portion.
    - The full program allows the creation of multiple chatboxes with unique usernames. Each chatbox has access to one chatroom that logs
      the messages, new chatbox users and leaving chatbox users.
    - Relevent Files: ChatBox.java
      
3. Simple ASCII Turn Based Adventure
    - Programming Language: C++
    - Simple turn based game that tracks player and enemy positions on a grid and simulated a battle on collision.
    - Relevent Files: adv.cpp
