## Data Analytics

1. Title 1 Texas school district report
    - Utilized sklearn, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries within python
      notebooks. Performed cleaning, exploration, normalization and
      visualization of Texas school districts data. Utilized linear regression
       and decision tree models to analyze the effects of poverty levels.
    - Data pulled from Common Core Data (CCD)
    
## Other Resume Projects
#### *Not public by professor request*

1. Discrete Time Event Simulation
    - Programming Language: Python
    - CPU simulation from a list of 10,000 generated "processes". 
      Uses four different queues to simulate the processes requesting CPU time.
      After the process list has been simulated, the performance metrics are calculated.
      
2. Parallel K-means Clustering
    - Programming Language: C with CUDA
    - Dividing n observations into x clusters using k-means. Uses atomic operations to update array data in parallel. 
      Utilizing CUDA multiple GPUs where used in the UT supercomputer cluster to time and run the program.
